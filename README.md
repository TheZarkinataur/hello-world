Working through the tutorial repo
I'm really getting into this stuff more and more. Commits, pull requests, push requests and branching - woohoo
I'm a dude who is trying to figure out this stuff on a regular basis.

Checking for the updates to work on GitHub and committing status = 29/6/2025
I love Computing Tech students in Year 10
